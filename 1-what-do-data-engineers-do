Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements? Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. 

Start by asking what the business goal is. 

Then, what data infra do they need? Real time analysis, data streams, big processors/compute, etc.

Think about what kind of data is needed for what kind of analysis. 

Set up data warehouse/lake/stream.

Create data model.

Develop pipelines.

Deploy and monitor data infra.
